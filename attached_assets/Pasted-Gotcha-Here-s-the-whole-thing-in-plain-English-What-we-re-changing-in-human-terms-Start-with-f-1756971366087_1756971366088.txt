Gotcha. Here’s the whole thing in plain English.

What we’re changing (in human terms)

Start with famous movies only (for the test).
The 12 A/B rounds will use a small set of well-known films so choices are easy and meaningful. Think “Die Hard vs Groundhog Day,” not two random obscurities.

Ask smarter questions each round.
After every pick, the app learns a bit about your taste. The next pair is chosen where we’re most unsure about you and the two options are very different. That way, every click teaches a lot—like 20 Questions.

Learn from winners vs losers, not vague vibes.
Each choice updates a simple “taste meter” that says: “more like the winner, less like the loser.” Do that 12 times and we get a very clear profile.

Only show trailers that match AND aren’t near-duplicates.
When the test ends, we score the full catalogue and pick 5 trailers that fit you—then we spread them out so you don’t get five Batman variants. (Relevant + not redundant.)

No dead ends.
We only pick titles that we already know have a working YouTube trailer and a “Where to watch” row. No more blanks.

Avoid repeats.
We remember what you just saw and cool down those titles for a few rounds, and we cap it at one per franchise in the 5.

The flow (like a funnel)

Rounds 1–4: Big, obvious contrasts (Action vs Comedy, Drama vs Animation, etc.).

Rounds 5–8: Focus on your top 1–2 genres (e.g., newer vs older within Crime).

Rounds 9–12: Fine-tune with one that’s very “you” vs one near your boundary.

After that, you get 5 on-taste trailers, one at a time, with Next/Back and Where to watch buttons.

Do you need a bigger catalogue?

Not huge, but you need coverage. Your three lists are a fine start; adding a few more (recent best-of and top-100 per genre) will give the picker more good options without changing the UX.

The A/B test itself uses a small famous set (≈120–160 anchors). The final trailers come from the full set.

What “better” will look like

The 12 choices feel easy and make sense.

The 5 trailers feel on-taste, not just popular.

You rarely see the same franchise twice in the 5.

The trailer screen always has working video + Where to watch links.
