You’re seeing “Cannot GET /” because the server isn’t serving the built client (wrong static path / no client build). Here’s the fastest, copy-paste fix to get back to a working app from your ZIP—no fluff.

0) Start fresh from your ZIP

In the Replit Shell (bottom), run:

# replace with the exact filename you uploaded
unzip -o FileVault_1.zip
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install

1) Ensure the server serves the built client

Open server/src/index.ts and make sure the static path points to dist/client (because compiled server is in dist/server and client build goes to dist/client):

import express from "express";
import path from "path";

const app = express();
app.disable("x-powered-by");
app.use(express.json());

// ✅ Mount API first (keep your existing /api router here)
// app.use("/api", api);

// ✅ Serve the built client
const clientDir = path.resolve(__dirname, "../client"); // __dirname = dist/server
app.use(express.static(clientDir));
app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(clientDir, "index.html"));
});

const PORT = Number(process.env.PORT || 3000);
app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => console.log("Server on", PORT));


If the Replit Agent created a stray server/index.ts (not under src/), delete it so we only build from server/src.

2) Make sure Vite outputs to dist/client

Open client/vite.config.ts and set:

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: "dist/client",
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
});

3) Scripts & run command

In package.json (root), ensure:

{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "start:prod": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/index.js"
  }
}


In .replit:

run = "npm run start:prod"

4) Secrets

Left sidebar → Secrets:

TMDB_API_KEY = your TMDb key
(Do not use TMDB_API_READ; ignore what the agent added.)

5) Build & run

Back in the Shell:

npm run build
npm run start:prod


Open the webview. You should now see your UI (not “Cannot GET /”).

Why this fixes it

“Cannot GET /” = Express didn’t find / and wasn’t pointing to the client build. We explicitly serve dist/client and send index.html for all routes.

Vite puts the client exactly where the server expects it.

Replit runs the compiled server (dist/server/index.js) that knows where to find the built client.
